to disable the Lid Switch:

Open the file /etc/systemd/logind.conf as root.

Find this: HandleLidSwitch

If it's commented, uncomment and change the value to ignore. The line after editing should be:

HandleLidSwitch=ignore
Restart computer and your problem should be gone. Or better restart logind service:

sudo service systemd-logind restart
